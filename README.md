## Description
A tictactoe AI that is impossible to beat. Made using Dart and Flutter ❤ Both the UI and the backend of the application was made using Flutter and Dart. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to look through all the possible combination of game states and returns the best one. It will always make the best possible move so the best case for the user is a draw.
